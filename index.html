         <h1>Visiting Las Vegas, Zion National Park and Death Valley</h1>
         <p>
            Earlier this year in March, I decided to go on a trip with 
            my best friend for my birthday. One of the places I had 
            wanted to visit was Las Vegas after hearing about how fun 
            and lively a city it was. We wanted to also visited a few 
            other places while we were there so our Vegas trip ended 
            up being more of a mini road trip around Nevada, Utah and 
            Arizona. We decide to go for a week and visited the Las 
            Vegas Strip, Zion National Park and Death Valley.

            <h2>Las Vegas, NV</h2>
            <p>
               We wanted to try everything that we could in Vegas 
               that we couldn't experience here in the midwest. 
               When we landed in Vegas, we had to try in & out which 
               was the first place we went to after picking up our 
               rental car. We then headed to our hotel, The Signature 
               at MGM Grand on the Las Vegas Strip. The drive to the 
               hotel down the strip was incredible. The whole street 
               was lit up and we got to see so many incredible places 
               like the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio Hotel.
